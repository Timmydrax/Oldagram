# Oldagram 📸

Oldagram is a simple Instagram clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a classic layout for displaying user posts, mimicking the core design of Instagram's post feed.

## 🌟 Features

- Clean and responsive layout
- Post feed with user details, images, and captions

## 🚀 Upcoming Features

I plan to enhance Oldagram with the following features:
